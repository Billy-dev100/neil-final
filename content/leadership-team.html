OU​R MISSION

Our Mission is to Trade at a level of success that will benefit all Shareholders, Stakeholders and Employees.

Going further, Oil is a benchmark on the well-being of many Countries, Organisations, Governments and its Peoples.

The opportunity to Spread-Bet on Oil exists perpetually, whether the Price is $100 a barrel or $40 a barrel, whether the Price is rising or falling, whether we are in a ‘BULL’ or a ‘BEAR’ Market and whatever the geopolitical factors are.

Managing Administrator- Neil G Van Luven says:

"My current success rate of 92.6% of his trades were profitable, with only 7.4% resulting in losses (by the number of trades), 94.3% profitable with 5.7% losses (by the monetary value of the trades) – is too extraordinary and improbable to be believed but nevertheless happened!"

We firmly believe that by concentrating on just a handful of products gives us the edge as it enables us to avoid the massive amount of "White Noise" that continuously impacts the market generally and is enormously distracting to Traders.

Finally, we develop unique algorithms that do the repetitive work thereby enabling the Trader to concentrate his attention to those matters that cannot be done by algorithms alone.
