When we undertake our Diagnostic Review of a business seeking to increase their cash availability, one of the steps we include is a review of the creditors/accounts payable in detail. We apply some of our proprietary analytical systems to this task, which gives insight that can lead to better financial management. The Diagnostic Review phase is always of interest to us at Moneypower Global.

We learn a lot about a business from the way relationships are managed. Having good relationships with your suppliers is vitally important, given the role they provide to the business. In the false hope of keeping these relationships strong, we see businesses paying their suppliers far too early and before the due date. Why? Maybe they have a personal relationship with the supplier and to keep it solid they pay them quickly, or maybe the supplier is short of cash, and they push for payment before the due date. Often it is not this at all. It is that the systems and procedures in use batch invoices together and pay the batch. Included in the batch are invoices that should never be there. Such systems require an upgrade.

**Priority Suppliers**

All businesses have priority suppliers they need to pay promptly. It could be the company’s biggest supplier, and they might be giving you a discount by paying them promptly. It could be other regular bills such as a commercial mortgage. Determining which suppliers need to be paid precisely on due date but never early and which suppliers can wait is an important key to managing your cash. To express it another way, your customers will not pay your invoices if they are not properly cleared, i.e. if there is an outstanding query that is unresolved. You must apply the same process with your suppliers. Dealing with this important element of your relationship will enable you to maximise your cash availability but simultaneously enhance your reputation.

**Supplier Credit Terms**

Suppliers offer credit terms of 14, 30 or 45 days or perhaps you have negotiated 60 or more days. These are your payment terms, so don’t pay too quickly and keep the cash in the business.

**Remember, businesses go under because they run out of cash, not because they’re not profitable.**

Systems and procedures should be in place to ensure that your business is maximising cash management. These will make certain that accounts are paid at the optimum time given all the circumstances. The larger your organisation is, the greater the need is to manage this aspect efficiently, so nothing slips through.

The ‘Best In Class’ Systems and Procedures to manage your suppliers can be a complex challenge and can be very time-consuming. At Moneypower Global, we can do this for you and generate more cash for your business in the process.
