**With Brexit looming heavily** and uncertainty on the horizon, there is an inevitability of those new year goals being disrupted. It’s important to look ahead and plan for the numerous possibilities that face the UK, and there are improvements and processes that can be put in place now to help businesses generate more cash flow and minimise the uncertain outcome of Brexit.

**It is important for both small and large businesses** to take control of its payments from its customers and to its suppliers which can make all the difference. The government is vowing to step up their efforts and take control of late payments to small businesses and get them paid within five days. Why not? The small businesses out there are our next PLCs.

**Most large businesses have** their own accounts packages that have set payment terms to pay their suppliers. It’s virtually impossible for small businesses to negotiate better terms and they normally must work with a portal to load the invoice – causing extra administration. It’s not unusual for large companies to request a reduction in the invoice value if the supplier wants it paid in under 14 days, further squeezing margins.

**Large businesses** can review their receivables and payables to keep their cash flowing. Moneypower sees many businesses paying their creditors within five days, which is great for their suppliers when most businesses offer 30 payment terms. If a larger supplier offers payment terms, you should pay on these terms, **and not earlier**, to help manage your cash flow.

**In today’s financial world** we have access to financial packages including flexible overdrafts, selective invoice finance, invoice discounting or factoring products to help bridge the gap between supplying products or services and getting paid for them. These products have their advantages and generate working capital within hours for a growing business, and normally with little security required from the finance provider. However, they come at a cost and as a business grows, so too the cost of the financial product.

**Moneypower specialises in helping businesses optimise** their receivables and payables, along with processes and procedures resulting in a plan of action to improve cash flow and working capital. We support businesses through the process by engaging with employees and help them make the necessary changes. Training of employees is one of the most important requirements that need addressing from the FD down to the finance assistants who are dealing with the payments. With our service, there is no need for extra financial products and businesses can expect more than a 250% ROI.
