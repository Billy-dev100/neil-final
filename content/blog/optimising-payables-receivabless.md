**Managing your sales ledger** on a day-to-day basis is just as important as bringing in new sales. Having control over the ledger is vital to success and growing the business.

**With my 20 years of experience** in banking and finance, when I review a business, I always pick up a sales ledger first before looking at the up-to-date accounts. You can tell how well a business is being run by looking at the sales ledger. Ideally, 70% of the ledger should be in the ‘current to 30 days’ column, 25% in ‘31 to 60 days’, and 5% in ‘61 plus’. It would be beneficial if all business ledgers ran like this, but in reality, this isn’t the case. If you have a lot of customers with long payment terms, you’re likely to be waiting a long time for funds to be paid, which can cause day-to-day cash flow problems.

It’s important to stay on top of the sales ledger and to get payments in on time. However, sending invoices out and posting to the ledger is just the start of getting your payment in.

**There are lots of ways you can manage payments and customers more effectively.**

1. **Know your customer.** Check their accounts on Companies House and look at the balance sheet, what is their net worth, how much cash have they got in the bank? Make sure they’re a sound business – they’ll be more likely to pay you on time.
2. **Make sure you agree** on suitable payment terms at the beginning, and you’re clear on your payment terms with the customer, don’t just be pleased to have the business. Making your terms clear and understood with the decision-maker is important. Ensure this information is passed onto the finance team and the person who will be paying your invoices, especially if you’re working with a large company.
3. **Try and ensure** your finance team and the customer’s finance team are on good terms and know each other well. Business can be won and lost on relationships, and this goes for all departments. Knowing who to call to chase payments and answer queries saves a lot of time and effort.

   **Top tip: When visiting your customer after you have done work together, continue building your relationships and help keep the competitors out. Ask to meet some of the teams in finance and other departments. Saying hello and thank you can go a long way.**
4. **Send statements** out to your customers. It’s a great way to remind your customers about outstanding invoices, and you can do this easily in most account packages now.
5. **All this can be a challenge** if you have different ledgers in different currencies. Payments can get held up by third parties like banks or be subject to additional security checks. With overseas customers, the upfront payment is the preferred choice or at least 50% of the invoice upfront. It can be difficult to chase money overseas, and if it turns out to be a bad debt, this can be even more complex and drawn out. Once again, make sure your customer is clear on payment terms.
