I was somewhat disturbed to read in yesterday's Times, the following article by James Hurley Enterprise Editor.

  
**LARGER COMPANIES 'ARE IGNORING RULES' OVERPAYING THEIR BILLS**

More than 1,000 business are flouting the law by ignoring rules that oblige them to report how long they take to pay suppliers. An analysis of government data by the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply highlighted a significant minority of large companies that had not complied with "duty to report" rules designed to clamp down on late payment of bills. Since 2017, large businesses have been required to publish reports on payments to suppliers at least twice per year. About 15,000 companies should have reported by now, but fewer than 14,000 submissions have been reported on the government portal.

The institute, which represents supply chain professionals, said that the government must police the rules and ban those who cannot show that they pay suppliers on time from government work. The data showed that one-third of invoices were being paid late. BHP Billiton, DHL and GKN were among those "named and shamed" for not meeting the terms of the code.

From September of this year, any supplier who bids for a government contract worth more than £5 Million a year will be required to answer questions about their payment practices and performance. The expected standard is to pay 95% of invoices with 60 days.
