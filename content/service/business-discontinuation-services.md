### **A Constructive Approach to Discontinued Business.**

In addition to advisory services, Moneypower International offers a specialised business discontinuation service. Many organisations eliminate business lines or offerings over time, and the collection of outstanding receivables in such a situation can prove challenging.

Often, the customers owing money will continue to do business with remaining business lines. This poses two equally unattractive options: either writing off the debt or engaging collection agencies whose conduct can irretrievably damage the customer relationship and thus the other selling prospects.

> Moneypowerâ€™s constructive approach to discontinued business enables collection of money owed and preservation, even strengthening, of the customer relationship. This is done through professional and conciliatory interaction with customers where issues are confronted and resolved to both parties satisfaction.

###### Such engagements incorporate a dedicated Moneypower taskforce in place for a fixed duration and remunerated on a performance-related basis.
