### **Generate Improvements Detailed in the Diagnostic Review.**

When a Client requires external assistance to generate the improvements detailed in the Moneypower review report, Moneypower assists and spearheads the implementation effort as required by the Client. The implementation effort includes:

1. New & Enhanced Tools and Reporting
2. Extensive Functional Training and “Cash” Education importance
3. Process and Procedural Evolution
4. Augmented Communication Processes
5. Strengthening of Internal Controls and Delegation of Authority

> **Moneypower’s specialised metrics and reporting methodologies provide tremendous insight into performance and enable “early alert” of impending challenges.**

Moneypower's educational services are modular in nature and enable greatly augmented organisation-wide cash awareness. The personnel learn the positive and negative consequences of behaviour and workflow. Non-finance personnel become cash and finance aware. Amongst the various modules of education are:

1. “Cash College” – An education program that introduces the basics of working capital and cash flow
2. Pre-Collection and Dispute Management – A receivables specific program that deals with early identification of customer satisfaction issues and their effective management, resolution, and measurement
3. Supplier Relationship Handling – A payables specific program focusing on managing supplier expectations and safeguarding the treasury
4. Cash Positive Selling and Contracting – An advanced program focusing on the optimisation of customer contracts to maximise cash benefits and to avoid cash traps
5. Cash Positive Purchasing – An advanced programme that focuses on the optimisation of supplier contracts

The use of the modular approach (with widespread dissemination of sessions) provides a forum for sharing experiences and cases, improved awareness of roles and responsibilities, and greater empathy for functional challenges.

Moneypower's implementation services strengthen internal resources and knowledge bases rather than to reinvent them. Moneypower is also experienced in building shared service structures from ground zero where necessary or appropriate.
