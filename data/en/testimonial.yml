    to advance the computerization of our Export Sales Ledger activities. This has
    been made possible due to the help of Moneypower International’s team of Practitioners
    provided this past year. I would like to express my gratitude for the excellent
    manner in which your Project Director has instilled a highly effective spirit
    of co-operation with our staff.

  content: My recent review of the European reports again causes a hearty “Congratulations”
    to all involved at Moneypower for the im­pressive performance results they have
    consistently aided Unisys to achieve in France, Italy and Spain. Cash generation
    potential well in excess of the $53 Million and other difficult, challenging performance
    gains identified through the Diagnostic Review briefing reports have now been
    clearly and tangibly demonstrated for these historically frustrating operations.

    last twenty-one years and they have always performed way beyond expectations.
    The tougher the receivables problem, the better the result Moneypower delivers.
    They are not great at PowerPoint presentations, do not have HBS degrees and do
    not feel like McKinsey or Bain, but they sure deliver sustainable cash-flow improvements.
    Nobody else I know of works at their level of detail
