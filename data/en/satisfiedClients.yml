  For more than four decades, Moneypower International’s services have evolved to meet Client requirements. In the beginning, Moneypower provided collection-oriented assistance that focused on post-billing issues. Over the years, the scope and depth of the services have evolved to encompass the entire accounts receivable and accounts payable process life-cycles.

  Moneypower International has assisted more than 1,000 Clients in more than 48 different countries/jurisdictions to generate in excess of $55 billion on a permanent and sustainable basis. In turn, this has optimised EBITA and enhanced the Clients’ customer and supplier relationships contributing to greater sales.

  Optimum A/R and A/P management and performance both increase sales as well as safeguarding the Client’s treasury. In addition, Clients’ customers are considerably much happier as customer satisfaction issues are highlighted, surfaced and resolved rapidly and systematically —nothing is overlooked and the Client's customers needs are respected and taken on board.
