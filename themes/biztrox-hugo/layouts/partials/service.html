                   <p>At Moneypower International, our services follow a time-tested model continuously enhanced over many decades. Engagements begin with a diagnostic review of all aspects of the applicable A/R and A/P operation of the Client.</p>

                    <p>The review specifies and quantifies the cash generation immediately available, what steps are required to achieve it, the delineated time-frame and the degree to which the Client has internal resources to contribute to making the necessary evolution and performance improvement. Moneypower drives it to successful completion. </p>
                    <p> Where the Client requires Moneypower International’s business discontinuation services, full details of the business to be discontinued are disclosed to Moneypower so that we can determine the “task force” configuration needed to complete the project, the estimated time frame, and the A/R contingency percentage to be charged, as no fixed fees are payable. </p>

                    <p>Moneypower International’s business discontinuation service is on a strict “Payment by Results” basis. Details of how this is achieved are available on request.
                                    </p>
